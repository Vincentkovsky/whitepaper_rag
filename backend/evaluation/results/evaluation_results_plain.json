As a result, a significant portion of our named executive officers’ total compensation is entirely at risk, depending on long-term stock price performance.\n\n8\n\nWhile we strive to offer a total level of compensation that is competitive within specific roles and geographical markets, we do not have a rigid set of criteria for granting equity awards; instead, the Compensation Committee exercises its judgment and discretion, in consultation with our Chief Executive Officer and from time to time, a compensation consultant (other than with respect to decisions pertaining to the Chief Executive Officer’s compensation). To determine the form and amount of equity awards previously granted to named executive officers, the Compensation Committee considers, among other things, the role and responsibility of the named executive officer, competitive market factors, equity awards previously granted to the named executive officer, the impact of any dramatic changes in our stock price over a short period of time and the cash-based compensation received by the named executive officer. We generally grant one-time new hire equity awards to our employees, including executives, upon their commencement of employment with us, or upon their promotion to a new position. Additionally, as part of our ongoing executive compensation review and alignment process, we have periodically granted additional equity awards to our executives.\n\nThe Compensation Committee granted an equity award to Mr. Taneja in October 2024, following the 2024 review of our compensation programs discussed in “Compensation Philosophy” above and considering his promotion in August 2023 to the role of Chief Financial Officer.Approximately 80% of Mr. Taneja’s equity award was granted as stock options and 20% of the award was granted as restricted stock units. See “Grants of Plan-Based Awards in 2024” and “Executive Compensation— Outstanding Equity Awards at 2024 Fiscal Year-End” under this Item 11 below for a description of the equity awards granted to Mr. Taneja. The Compensation Committee did not grant any equity awards in 2024 to our other named executive officers, including our Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThe Compensation Committee meets periodically, including to approve equity award grants to our executives from time to time. We do not have, nor do we plan to establish, any program, plan or practice to time equity award grants in coordination with releasing material non-public information, and the Compensation Committee does not take material non-public information into account when determining the timing and terms of equity awards. Tesla has not timed the disclosure of material non-public information to affect the value of executive compensation. During 2024, there were no stock options granted to any named executive officer within four business days preceding, or within one business day after, the filing of any report on Forms 10-K, 10-Q or 8-K that discloses material non-public information.\n\nSeverance and Change in Control Benefits\n\nNo named executive officer has a severance or change in control arrangement with Tesla.\n\nBonus\n\nWe do not currently have or have planned, and historically we have rarely entered into, any specific arrangements with our named executive officers providing for cash-based bonus awards.\n\nNon-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation\n\nWe did not provide any non-equity incentive plan compensation to any of our named executive officers in 2024, and we do not currently have or have planned any specific arrangements with our named executive officers providing for non-equity incentive plan\n\ncompensation.\n\nPerquisites\n\nGenerally, we do not provide any perquisites or other personal benefits to our named executive officers which are not offered on a non-discriminatory basis to all employees as well.\n\nHealth and Welfare Benefits",

        "Section: Current Elements of Named Executive Officer Compensation\n\nBase Salary\n\nThe Compensation Committee is responsible for reviewing our Chief Executive Officer’s and other executive officers’ base salaries. The base salaries of all executive officers are reviewed and adjusted when necessary to reflect individual roles, performance and the competitive market. Because we currently do not provide cash bonuses to our executive officers, salary is the primary cash- based element of our executive officers’ compensation structure.\n\nIn connection with the 2024 review of our compensation programs discussed in “Compensation Philosophy” above, the Compensation Committee increased Mr. Taneja’s base salary to reflect his promotion in August 2023 to the role of Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Zhu’s base salary decreased in 2024 as compared to 2023 due to certain geographic considerations that arose in 2023 when he was on assignment from Gigafactory Shanghai. The following table sets forth information regarding the annualized base salary rates at the end of 2024 for our named executive officers:\n\nAndrew Baglino\n\n—(3)\n\n(1)\n\nReflects an annualized rate assuming 52 weeks each comprised of five work days. Mr. Taneja’s base salary was adjusted in October 2024.\n\n(2)\n\nMr. Musk historically earned a base salary that reflected the applicable minimum wage requirements under California law, and he was subject to income taxes based on such base salary. However, he has never accepted his salary. Commencing in May 2019 at Mr. Musk’s request, we eliminated altogether the earning and accrual of this base salary.\n\nMr. Baglino departed Tesla in April 2024. His annualized base salary rate at his time of departure was $300,000.\n\nEquity-Based Incentives\n\nOur equity award program is the primary vehicle for offering long-term incentives to our named executive officers. The equity awards we have historically granted and currently grant are options to purchase shares of our common stock and restricted stock unit awards that are settled in shares of our common stock upon vesting. We have granted to our named executive officers both awards that vest over a long-term period and awards that vest only upon the achievement of specified Tesla performance milestones, in each case subject to continued service. We emphasize the grant of stock option awards for our named executive officers, which have value only to the extent, if any, that our stock price increases following their grant. Accordingly, since 2020, equity awards granted to our named executive officers have primarily been in the form of stock options: Mr. Zhu, our Senior Vice President,APAC, received 100% of his equity award as stock options upon his promotion to such role in 2023, and Mr. Taneja, our Chief Financial Officer, received approximately 80% of his equity award as stock options in 2024, following the 2024 review of our compensation programs discussed in"

        "Section: Other Information\n\nOn June 4, 2018, a Tesla shareholder filed a shareholder derivative complaint in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Mr. Musk and certain current and former Tesla directors in connection with the Tesla Board’s approval of the 2018 CEO Performance Award. On January 30, 2024, the Court issued a post-trial opinion that granted the plaintiff’s request that the 2018 CEO Performance Award be fully rescinded. In addition, following the recommendation of a special committee of the Board, the Board (with Mr. Musk and Kimbal Musk recusing themselves) determined that the ratification of the 2018 CEO Performance Award was in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, approved the ratification (the “Ratification”) of the 2018 Performance Award, directed that the Ratification be submitted to the shareholders at the 2024 annual meeting, and recommended that shareholders approve the Ratification. The Ratification was approved by the shareholders at the 2024 annual meeting. Following the Ratification, Tesla requested that the Delaware Court revise its decision to rescind the 2018 CEO Performance Award. On December 2, 2024, the Delaware Court rejected the request to revise its decision. On December 13, 2024, the Delaware Court entered a final judgment rescinding the 2018 CEO Performance Award. Tesla is appealing the Delaware Court’s decision to not recognize the Ratification, its decision to reject the request to revise its decision, and its judgment rescinding the 2018 CEO Performance Award. The current and former Tesla directors are also appealing the Delaware Court’s post-trial decision.",
